Back from the dead!
-Am going to put in some real hours into this now: here's the plan,
-First I'll design somthing that can run on localhost, with a simple db as a standin for user login (no real stocks involved yet :) )
-^ should be simple, done this before... a while ago... Time to shake off the rust you know
-Next is getting cross compatable with mobile, 
-Next is figuring the web domain and seeing if a suitable domain name can be bought on the cheap $
-Figure out block chain
-Figure out legal possesion of proporty through block chain (can they evict you?)
-Code the block chain (or piggy back on smth public) and find place to run it all (or pay arm & leg to host)

This is todo List. Hold me acountable!

List of hours put in from all time:
Feb 6- 1hr
